## How It Works
* Users authenticate with their Spotify account so the network calls can be made to pull the proper data
* Network calls are made by Spartan's functions
* The HomeController will have a tableview populated by the user's top artists according to Spotify
* Users can browse the artists' top 10 tracks and play a 30 second preview
* Users can save tracks at the local level using CoreData
